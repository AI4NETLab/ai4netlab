  abstract = {The Web is one of the most successful Internet application. Yet, the quality of Web users' experience is still largely impenetrable. Whereas Web performances are typically gathered with controlled experiments, in this work we perform a large-scale study of one of the most popular Web sites, namely Wikipedia, explicitly asking (a small fraction of its) users for feedback on the browsing experience. We leverage user survey responses to build a data-driven model of user satisfaction which, despite including state-of-the art quality of experience metrics, is still far from achieving accurate results, and discuss directions to move forward. Finally, we aim at making our dataset publicly available, which hopefully contributes in enriching and refining the scientific community knowledge on Web users' quality of experience (QoE).},

  abstract = {Pervasive encryption makes it hard for ISPs to manage their network. Yet, to avoid user churn at times of shrinking revenues, ISPs must be able to assess the quality of experience they are delivering to their customers. The case of the Web is particularly complex, with a plethora of recently proposed in-browser metrics that aim at capturing the page visual rendering quality (e.g. Above the Fold and SpeedIndex). In this demo, we showcase that such metrics can be estimated quite accurately just from streams of encrypted packets, using classic supervised learning techniques.},
