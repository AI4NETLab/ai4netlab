abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) shows promising potential for enhancing networking tasks by providing early traffic predictions. However, implementing an ML-enabled system is a challenging task due to network devices limited resources. While previous works have shown the feasibility of running simple ML models in the data plane, integrating them into a practical end-to-end system is not an easy task. It requires addressing issues related to resource management and model maintenance to ensure that the performance improvement justifies the system overhead. In this work, we propose DUMBO, a versatile end-to-end system to generate and exploit early flow size predictions at line rate. Our system seamlessly integrates and maintains a simple ML model that offers early coarse-grain flow size prediction in the data plane. We evaluate the proposed system on flow scheduling, per-flow packet inter-arrival time distribution, and flow size estimation using real traffic traces, and perform experiments using an FPGA prototype running on an AMD(R)-Xilinx(R) Alveo U280 SmartNIC. Our results show that DUMBO outperforms traditional state-of-the-art approaches by equipping network devices data planes with a lightweight ML model.
