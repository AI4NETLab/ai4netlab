		abstract={
Panel experts  S. Banerjee (Director of Research, VMware, USA)   S. Majumdar  (Intel’s AI Lab, USA),  D. Rossi (Huawei, France) and D. Pei (Tsinghua University, China) will discuss Emerging Trends in AI/ML and Implications for Networking Research, in a panel organized by  A. Gosain (Northeastern University, USA) and moderated  by  N. Himayat (Intel Labs).

Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence techniques promise new design methodologies and tools for architecting communication networks and automating network operation.  At the same time, the increasingly powerful and ubiquitous compute-communication capabilities of emerging networks, are driving AI/ML computations closer to the edge; a shift that promises to democratize AI services and enable a wide variety of new AI usages. 

AI/ML technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, moving from a paradigm of supervised learning towards distributed self-learning, cognitive reasoning and general intelligence.  Although AI models are becoming increasingly powerful, several challenges in wide-scale deployment of AI/ML solution have been identified. They include growing computational complexity and power consumption of AI/ML models, access to sufficient real-world data to drive AI/ML research, robustness of learning solutions in practical deployments, susceptibility to adversarial attacks, and lack of explainability of AI models.

Exploiting the power of AI/ML solutions to address the growing complexity of communication networks, while addressing the aforementioned challenges in the context of resource constrained, dynamic and mission critical environment of modern networks is an important topic of current research. This panel will highlight the emerging trends in AI/ML technology and discuss their implications for design, deployment and operation of next generation communication networks.},

ICT Infrastructures and the future Internet including 5G and beyond technologies, NFV, IoT, Cloud/Edge are the main enabling factors contributing to the digital transformation of our society. Their design, deployment and operation are critical, calling for a scientific instrument to support the research in this domain for computer science and infrastructure researchers, as well as for data driven scientific applications involving interdisciplinary aspects. In this talk, we will cover how the SLICES Research Infrastructure (RI) can benefit to AI research, and further expose constrain and requirements that AI empowered algorithms impose on the SLICES RI, to help steering the Next Generation of ICT Research Infrastructures.},
