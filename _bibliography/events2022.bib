Laurent Ciavaglia (Rakuten) will discuss emerging trends,  challenges and opportunities in making AI a first class citizen of the future network architecture, where AI is no longer an afterthought (as in +AI) but is rather the starting point of the equation (aka AI+) leading to the confluence of networking and AI and a more inter-wined evolution path.

The blending of network connectivity and advanced computing capabilities, both in the cloud as well as at the network edge, paves the way to the  advent of self-driving networks, thanks to a comprehensive and data-rich view of the underlying network components made possible by the current cloud-native network architecture. In the first wave of network AI research, the focus has been on how to leverage advances in AI technologies to carry out networking task (AI4NET), or how to evolve network technologies to facilitate execution of AI applications such as training (NET4AI).
At the same time, we acknowledge that so far AI adoption has been limited as an “addendum” to the existing network architecture, i.e., where specific isolated tasks were executed with the addition of AI (aka +AI):  this first wave of +AI adoption for IP networking started in the early 2000 and significantly accelerated on the last decade. A logical next step of this trend is that, to fully harness the power of AI, the network can evolve to embrace a larger synergy with AI technologies: under this premises, AI  would become a fundamental building block of a novel AI-Native network architecture, where AI is no longer an afterthought (as in +AI) but is rather the starting point of the equation (aka AI+) leading to the confluence of networking and AI and a more inter-wined evolution path.
Along this line of thoughts, panelist will discuss challenges and opportunities in making AI a first class citizen of the future network architecture.
