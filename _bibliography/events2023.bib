In this talk we first cover achievements of the current AI-assisted cloud-native architecture, which already empowers operators to deploy networks able to automatically adapt according to high-level goals, and next discuss challenges to move to, as well as benefits coming from, a fully AI-native network architecture. In particular, the talk will overviewing several key ingredients of network AI (explainable, automated, deployable and sustainable), and particular emphasize on the explainability/XAI angle.},

While the current AI-assisted cloud-native architecture already empowers operators to automate part of the network task, challenges remain to more systematically exploit AI in networks. In particular, the talk will emphasize need for explainability capabilities (XAI), and walkthrough over a gallery of XAI methods on the concrete networking use-case of traffic classification, including recent work that will appear at KDD'23.
